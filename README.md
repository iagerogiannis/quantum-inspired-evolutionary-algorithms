# Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithms

Welcome to the Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithms repository! This repository contains an implementation of quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms, which are a class of optimization algorithms inspired by principles from quantum mechanics.

## Introduction

Quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms combine concepts from evolutionary computation and quantum mechanics to solve optimization problems. These algorithms leverage the principles of superposition, entanglement, and measurement to explore the search space efficiently and find optimal solutions.

## Features

- Implementation of various quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms
- Support for different types of optimization problems
- Customizable parameters for fine-tuning the algorithms
- Documentation and examples to help you get started

## Getting Started

To get started with the Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithms, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/iagerogiannis/quantum-inspired-evolutionary-algorithms.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd quantum-inspired-evolutionary-algorithms`
3. Set up a virtual environment:
   - On Windows, run: `py -m venv .venv`
   - On Unix or MacOS, run: `python3 -m venv .venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows, run: `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On Unix or MacOS, run: `source .venv/bin/activate`
5. Install the required dependencies:
   - On Windows, run: `pip install -r requirements-win.txt`
   - On Unix or MacOS, run: `pip install -r requirements-unix.txt`
6. Run `ipython kernel install --user --name=quantum-inspired-evolutionary-algorithms`
7. Ensure you are running all Jupiter Notebooks using the kernel of the virtual environment you've just set up
8. Explore the examples and documentation to understand how to use the algorithms
9. Start experimenting with the algorithms on your own optimization problems
